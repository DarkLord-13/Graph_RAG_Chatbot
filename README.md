# Graph_RAG_Chatbot

**Graph_RAG_Chatbot** is a state-of-the-art chatbot framework that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver highly accurate, contextually relevant, and knowledge-grounded conversational responses. Designed for complex domains such as scientific research, enterprise knowledge bases, technical support, and more.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Graph-Based Knowledge Representation:** Utilizes knowledge graphs for structured, multi-hop reasoning.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Fuses dense retrievers with generative LLMs for knowledge-grounded conversation.
- **Multi-hop Reasoning:** Traverses and queries graph structures to answer complex, interconnected queries.
- **Customizable Pipelines:** Easily integrate your own graph databases, retrievers, and LLMs.
- **Extensible Data Sources:** Supports graph databases (Neo4j, RDF, etc.) and textual corpora.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **User Query:** The chatbot receives a user question.
2. **Graph Traversal:** Relevant entities and relations are retrieved from the knowledge graph using advanced graph algorithms.
3. **Context Retrieval:** Dense retrievers fetch related context or documents from textual or graph sources.
4. **Response Generation:** A language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Llama, etc.) generates an answer grounded in the retrieved context.
5. **Delivery:** The chatbot returns an informed, context-rich response.
